  <h3>Georgian Traditions of Hospitality</h3>
  <p>
    Traditions of hospitality in Georgia are professed in no uncertain terms in
    the Georgian proverb: “Every guest is a gift from God”. One of Georgia’s
    best known national monuments is Kartlis Deda – Mother of Georgia. Her
    statue stands high above Tbilisi bearing a sword in one hand and a goblet of
    wine in the other. This represents Georgia’s protective and hospitable
    attitude towards guests. Over centuries, Georgian people developed
    traditions of, and a reputation for, generosity and hospitality.This can be
    experienced in a Georgian’s home or in the street, in a village bazaar or on
    a Tbilisi subway. If a tourist stops a Georgian to ask for directions, the
    likelihood is that they will be personally escorted to their destination. If
    the Georgian isn’t sure, the situation instantly becomes a neighborhood
    affair with everyone in proximity dropping everything to assist until the
    dilemma is rectified.

  <h3>Traditional Feast</h3>

  <p>
    The Georgian tradition of hospitality is epitomized by the ceremonial feast
    of Supra. Supra is celebrated on birthdays, death days, weddings,
    anniversaries, national holidays, religious holidays, days of commemoration,
    in honor of a guest, and even ad hoc for no other reason than a fortuitous
    gathering of close friends. Either way, wine is consumed in ample
    quantities. At supra, wine shares equal importance with food. The dinner is
    comprised of a series of toasts offered by Tamada (“toast master”) to be
    embellished by the other guests. Topics include love, family, individual
    dedications, nationalist themes, life and death, and god. Blessings, jokes,
    anecdotes and humorous recollections are integral. A tourist invited to
    supra should expect multiple dedications which are usually translated by one
    of the younger attendants.

  <h3>Georgian Wine Traditions</h3>

  <p>
    The Georgian attitude toward wine is summarized in the following stanza of a
    traditional song: "If you'd had a drink and became sad - You're not a man,
    you are not a Georgian". For Georgians, wine is not just a drink. Wine
    strengthens the national spirit and unites guests of traditional Caucasian
    feasts. Grapevines are mentioned in Georgian legends, stories and songs.
    Wine in Georgia is a national asset attracting tourists and sommeliers from
    all over the world. The Georgian tradition of winemaking is thought to have
    originated approximately eight thousand years ago. Throughout history,
    winemaking has not only the basis of Georgia’s economy but also a part of
    its spiritual culture.

  <h3>Georgian Wedding Traditions</h3>

  <p>
    Georgian wedding tradition begins with machankloba. This is the tradition of
    matchmaking. It involves family members and friends who assist in arranged
    meetings to match prospective couples. The next step is nishnoba which
    represents engagement and culminates in the wedding ceremony of kortsili.
    Georgian weddings are known for an immense number of invited guests which
    can exceed two hundred per family. All invited guests are expected to attend
    and to decline is considered extremely offensive, sometimes warranting the
    end of a friendship and possibly instigating an ongoing family feud.
    Bridesmaids and groomsmen are expected to refrain from romantic association
    with each other. This too can result in enmity among everyone involved.

  <h3>Georgian Traditional Clothing</h3>

  <p>
    Georgian traditional clothing is an apt reflection of the cultural heritage
    of Georgia’s native peoples. Within the conventional attire of its national
    clothing, the Georgian people’s adaptability, devotion to tradition and
    appreciation of aesthetic beauty is conveyed.
