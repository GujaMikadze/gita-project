      <h3>Kakheti</h3>
      <p>
        Kakheti is Georgia’s biggest region by area, taking in the entire
        eastern part of the country. The landscape and climate varies
        dramatically from the high mountains of Tusheti in the north to the
        semi-desert landscapes of Udabno and Vashlovani in the south. In
        between, the Alazani river and its wide valley cut through from north to
        south, carving out dozens of different microclimates that in turn
        provide the perfect conditions for cultivating grapes. Georgia has more
        than 400 endemic varieties in total, many of which grow (or once grew)
        in fertile Kakheti. Today, this remains Georgia’s premier wine region,
        responsible for around 70% of the country’s harvest. Archaeological
        evidence dates Georgia’s winemaking tradition back to the 6th millennium
        BC, predating the earliest wine production in France by more than 5,000
        years. Wineries in Kakheti continue to live out this legacy.

        They vary from tiny family operations that stick to time-honoured
        natural winemaking methods all the way through to large commercial
        wineries that employ a mix of Qvevri and European-style techniques. Clay
        Qvevri jars scattered amongst tall green grass. Old Qvevris on the
        grounds of Ikalto Monastery outside Telavi, Kakheti. Aside from
        vineyards, Kakheti is known for its medieval monasteries and hilltop
        churches, many of which date back to the 5th or 6th century when Kakheti
        was its own self-governed kingdom. Wine cellars feature prominently in
        some of the oldest and most revered, including Alaverdi and the cave
        monasteries of David Gareja in southern Kakheti. Wine and religion are
        closely intertwined, with some of the country’s best-loved vintages
        bottled by monks. Winemaking, toasting and drinking are all tied
        inextricably to the nation’s history, folklore and religion. When you
        visit Kakheti, not only do you get to taste Georgian wine, you also get
        to immerse yourself completely in these cultural elements. This makes
        Kakheti a must-visit in my books. Some travellers only have time for a
        quick day trip from Tbilisi to Kakheti. If your Georgia itinerary
        allows, I highly recommend a longer sojourn in wine country. Three days
        is the perfect amount of time.

      <h3>Imereti</h3>
      <img src="../images/imereti1.jpg" alt="Bagrati" />
      <p>
        Imereti is a historical-geographical part of Georgia with very rich wine
        culture and heritage. You can even observe historical records about
        Imereti wines from the XVII-XVIII centuries. Imereti is right behind
        Kakheti in most of the wine production indicators and it is really
        necessary to understand the connection between these two wine regions as
        essential, as they produce two completely different characteristic
        wines. These two wine regions complement each other incredibly well and
        together they form a harmonious portrait of Georgian winemaking.
        Together Kakheti, with its strength and constancy, and, Imereti, with
        its elegance and energy, create Georgia’s wine profile.
